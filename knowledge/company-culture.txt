Improvado Company Culture and Values

Communication Style:
The team culture is informal and direct. No corporate speak. Daniel uses informal language and expects open, honest communication. Everyone is on first-name terms.

AI-First Mindset:
Every team member uses AI agents daily. Claude Code is the primary development tool. Engineers who don't adopt AI-assisted development are expected to learn. The company believes in "vibe coding" — using AI agents for development rather than traditional coding.

Speed and Impact:
The company values speed of execution. A small team with AI can accomplish in a weekend what others take months to do. The process from idea to production is fast.

Enterprise Focus:
Improvado is fundamentally a B2B Enterprise company, not PLG or B2C. This affects everything — from how products are built to how customers are served. Professional services and customization are key differentiators.

Intellectual Curiosity:
The team values people who read widely, have diverse interests, and think independently. Daniel personally is interested in philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and human consciousness.

Controversial Ideas Welcome:
The culture encourages intellectual courage and original thinking. Daniel regularly asks the Peter Thiel question: "What controversial idea do you believe that most people around you disagree with?"
